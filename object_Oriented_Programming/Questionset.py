# Define a class Car with attributes brand, model, and year. Create an object of this class.
#  Write a class Person with attributes name and age. Add a method introduce() that prints "Hi, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
#  Create a class Book with attributes title and author. Implement a method get_info() that returns the book details

# Constructors (__init__)
# Modify the Car class so that it initializes brand, model, and year using a constructor.
# Create a class Student with attributes name, roll_number, and marks initialized using __init__.

# Instance & Class Variables
# Create a class Employee that has instance variables name and salary, and a class variable company shared among all employees.
# Modify the Student class to include a class variable school_name which is common for all students.

# Methods & Self
# Define a class Circle with a method area() that calculates and returns the area of the circle.
# Create a class Account with a method deposit(amount) that adds the given amount to the balance.

# Encapsulation (Getters & Setters)
# Create a class BankAccount with a private attribute __balance and public methods deposit() and withdraw().
# Implement getter and setter methods for a Product class with a private attribute __price.

# Inheritance & Method Overriding
# Create a Vehicle class with method start(). Derive a Car class from Vehicle and override the start() method.
# Define a Parent class with a method display(). Create a Child class that inherits from Parent and overrides display().

#  Multiple Inheritance
# Implement a Father class and a Mother class, both having a method show_traits(). Create a Child class that inherits from both.

# Multi-level Inheritance
# Create a Animal → Mammal → Dog class hierarchy where each class adds some functionality.

# Polymorphism
# Define a Bird class with a method make_sound(). Create Sparrow and Crow classes that override make_sound().
# Create two classes Dog and Cat, both with a method speak(). Write a function that takes an object and calls speak().

# 11. Operator Overloading
# Overload the + operator to add two objects of a Vector class.
# Implement __lt__ (<) in a Student class to compare students based on marks.

# 12. Abstract Classes & Interfaces (abc module)
# Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area(). Implement Rectangle and Circle classes that inherit from Shape.

# 13. Property Decorator
# Use the @property decorator to create a read-only property price in a Product class.

# 14. Dunder (Magic) Methods
# Implement __str__() for a Book class so that print(book) returns a readable string.
# Use __repr__() in a Movie class to return a string suitable for debugging.

# 15. OOP Design Exercise
# Design a Library Management System using OOP concepts, with classes like Book, Member, and Library.
# Build a Banking System with Customer, Account, and Transaction classes.
